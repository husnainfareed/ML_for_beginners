# ML_for_beginners

Machine learning is one of the thrilling fields in today’s era. Newbies are excited to learn it but they somehow have no idea where to start from. 
In this tutorial, I have covered around everything that requires at least basic understanding and tools demand to get hand dirty in ML. 
Primarily, in order to dive into ML, one should have knowledge of Python, and Python’s libraries i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensor flow etc...  Although, there are much advanced tools and libraries updated regularly and are available on internet yet at least for ABC of ML, the resources available are adequate and enough.
I have categorized subdirectories in main repository with:
1.	Python 
2.	Numpy 
3.	Plotting Using Matplotlib 
4.	Pandas 
5.	Scikit-learn 
6.	Tensor Flow 
Installation Requirements:
-	Python :  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4.exe 
-	Paste these commands in cmd
    - pip install numpy
    - pip install matplotlib
    - pip install pandas
    - pip install –U scikit-learn 
    - pip install Jupyter : a web-application where you will code 

That’s it.
